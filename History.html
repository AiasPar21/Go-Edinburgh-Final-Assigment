                    <h1>Castles</h1>
                    <p>Edinburgh Castle is a historic castle in Edinburgh, Scotland. It stands on Castle Rock, which has been occupied by humans since at least the Iron Age, although the nature of the early settlement is unclear. There has been a royal castle on the rock since at least the reign of David I in the 12th century, and the site continued to be a royal residence until 1633. From the 15th century, the castle's residential role declined, and by the 17th century it was principally used as military barracks with a large garrison. Its importance as a part of Scotland's national heritage was recognised increasingly from the early 19th century onwards, and various restoration programmes have been carried out over the past century and a half.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    As one of the most important strongholds in the Kingdom of Scotland, Edinburgh Castle was involved in many historical conflicts from the Wars of Scottish Independence in the 14th century to the Jacobite rising of 1745. Research undertaken in 2014 identified 26 sieges in its 1,100-year history, giving it a claim to having been "the most besieged place in Great Britain and one of the most attacked in the world".[3] Few of the present buildings pre-date the Lang Siege of the 16th century when the medieval defences were largely destroyed by artillery bombardment. The most notable exceptions are St Margaret's Chapel from the early 12th century, which is regarded as the oldest building in Edinburgh,[4] the Royal Palace, and the early 16th-century Great Hall, although the interiors have been much altered from the mid-Victorian period onwards. The castle also houses the Scottish regalia, known as the Honours of Scotland, and is the site of the Scottish National War Memorial and the National War Museum of Scotland. The British Army is still responsible for some parts of the castle, although its presence is now largely ceremonial and administrative. Some of the castle buildings house regimental museums which contribute to its presentation as a tourist attraction.
                    <br>
                    <br>    
                    The castle, in the care of Historic Environment Scotland, is Scotland's most and the United Kingdom's second most-visited paid tourist attraction, with over 2.2 million visitors in 2019[5] and over 70 percent of leisure visitors to Edinburgh visiting the castle.[6] As the backdrop to the Royal Edinburgh Military Tattoo during the annual Edinburgh Festival, the castle has become a recognisable symbol of Edinburgh in particular and of Scotland as a whole.

                        <p>
                            The majority of the city’s top attractions are concentrated in the city centre and if you’re staying near the Royal Mile, it’s likely that you won’t need to take more than a few buses during your stay
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Places of interest that might be best to get to by public transport are the Royal Yacht Britannia, the Royal Botanic Garden, Portobello Beach or Edinburgh Zoo.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Edinburgh is a relatively small city, and its medieval air makes it ideal to visit by foot.

                    <h1>Athens of the North</h1>
                    <p>Edinburgh’s New Town is the largest and best preserved example of Georgian town planning anywhere in the UK.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Simply walking its streets gives a real sense of the past, and how life was lived 200 years ago. This was a time when the authors Sir Walter Scott and Jane Austen were at the height of their fame. Britain was emerging victorious from the long Napoleonic Wars with France, and George IV finally became king after a long regency.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The New Town has grand terraces and imposing monuments, but also more ordinary homes and the traces of everyday life in the 19th century. Today this historic area has not only a wealth of important buildings, but also galleries, cafes, restaurants and independent shops that are well worth a visit.</p>

                    <h1>The birth of Harry Potter</h1>
                    <p>Edinburgh has a deep connection with the wizarding world of Harry Potter and there are several Harry Potter sites in Edinburgh that fans can visit. Most notably, it was the home of J.K. Rowling when she wrote the majority of the Harry Potter books.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Rowling has acknowledged her connection to the city stating that “…Edinburgh is very much home for me and is the place where Harry evolved over seven books and many, many hours of writing in its cafés.”
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Want to sit and sip coffee in the same café that J.K. Rowling wrote the Harry Potter books? See turreted buildings that may have been the inspiration for Hogwarts? See graves and streets that may have influenced the names of Harry Potter characters? Drink a pint of butterbeer in a local pub? We’ll provide all you need to know to find these places on your own or visit them on a fun walking tour.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        However, as we dug into the evidence we found that some of the places and sights associated with J.K. Rowling and Harry Potter seem to be based more on fiction than reality. We’ll provide not only a list of the top Harry Potter sites in Edinburgh and how to visit them, but we’ll also try to separate fact from fiction in their relationship to Harry Potter and his famous inventor.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        We also provide a walking map of all the Harry Potter spots in Edinburgh to help you explore on your own, a graveyard map to the famous Tom Riddle grave and others, and a list of tour companies that offer guided Harry Potter tours.</p>
